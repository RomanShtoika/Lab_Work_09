# Lab_Work_09
# Description

This project involves the following tasks:

Task 1. Develop a simple graphical interface for solving an applied computing problem

and implement a Java program for its maintenance.

The interface should include a program window (frame), text fields for entering input data,

a field for outputting the result, and a button for starting the calculation.

"Additional task.

Modify the created program by adding the possibility of solving inverse problems.

That is, allow data entry in the field for the result of calculations 1 to program the following behavior of the window:

as soon as the data entered in the fields is sufficient to solve one of the possible problems, the field without data becomes unavailable, and the button should calculate
the corresponding value.

Option 14.

Find the kinetic energy of a body of mass m moving at a speed v.
